```Prerequisites
An Azure AD tenant. For more information see: How to get an Azure AD tenant
A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a personal Microsoft account. Therefore, if you signed in to the Azure portal with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
